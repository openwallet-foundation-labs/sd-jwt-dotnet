# Release Please Workflow
# This workflow automates semantic versioning and changelog generation based on
# Conventional Commits merged into the main branch.
#
# How it works:
#  1. On every push to main, Release Please analyzes commit messages.
#  2. It creates (or updates) a Release PR containing:
#     - Updated CHANGELOG.md with categorized changes.
#     - The next semantic version (determined by commit types).
#  3. When the Release PR is merged by a maintainer, Release Please:
#     - Creates the GitHub Release with the new tag (e.g., v1.2.0).
#     - The tag triggers the release.yml workflow to build and publish to NuGet.
