This directory contains thought leadership articles and technical insights about building privacy-preserving systems with Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens (SD-JWT).

## Articles

### [Beyond Redaction: Scaling Privacy-Preserving GenAI with SD-JWTs](ai-privacy-with-sd-jwt.md)

**Topic**: Privacy-preserving AI integration with cryptographic selective disclosure

**Key Concepts**:

- Golden Record paradox in financial systems
- All-or-nothing dilemma in AI context injection
- SD-JWT as architectural solution
- OpenID4VCI/VP for standardized workflows
- Federation & Status List for ecosystem trust
- HAIP compliance for government-grade systems
- Multi-turn conversation patterns with progressive disclosure
- Enhanced 2025 AI landscape (GPT-4o, o1-preview)

**Target Audience**:

- Enterprise architects designing AI systems with regulated data
- Financial services building personalized AI advisors
- Government agencies implementing privacy-preserving services
- Developers implementing SD-JWT in production

**Reading Time**: 25-30 minutes

**Key Takeaway**: Privacy and personalized AI are not mutually exclusive. By using SD-JWT with cryptographic selective disclosure, you can build AI systems that are context-aware yet privacy-preserving by design.
